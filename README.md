# Pok√©mon Modern Emerald

This is a decompilation of Pok√©mon Emerald, edited to be "Pok√©mon Modern Emerald".
You can get more information about Modern Emerald at [Pokecommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=494005)
You can the hackrom documentation following [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QEFJmFhfaZqgxSUnM7MFpufrnrRk_NMzNoNWl2m3y_0/edit#gid=414283818)

# If you want to compile:

Please follow [Pret's guide on how to build the rom](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/INSTALL.md) but using this branch instead of theirs. 
When compiling, **use the modern compiler** with the "make modern" command. 
_Compiling using the old compiler won't work._
The game was compiled using `(devkitARM release 62) 13.2.0`, but it should work up to `release 65`. Higher versions WON'T probably work, for many reasons, although it may be fixed in the future. For now, you can use those version releases.

# ‚ú®FEATURES

**Selectable options (at the start of the game):**

Gamemode page:

* Choose between a "Classic" or "Modern" preset, or customize it to your liking. **WARNING! All selected options are permanent until starting a new game.**
* Encounter modes: Original, New (aka Modern), and Post-game.
    - "Original encounters" are vanilla Emerald encounters with zero changes.
    - "New (modern) encounters" include all 423 Pok√©mon between the game and the post-game.
    - "Post-game encounters" are vanilla Emerald encounters UNTIL beating the game. Afterwards, it uses the "New encounters" tables.
* Modern Typings: Some Pok√©mon have their types changed to buff them (Check docs).
* Add Fairy Type: Adds Fairy Type to Pok√©mon that had it added in Generation 6.
* Better Stats: Some Pok√©mon have their stats changed to buff them (Check docs).
* Extra Legendaries: Adds new legendaries that weren't available in vanilla Emerald. Check docs for the location, or explore by yourself!
* Legendary abilities: Buffs some legendaries giving them a better ability than "Pressure".
* Modern Movepool: Adds 15 new moves, and modifies all Pok√©mon movepool to add them.
* Type chart: The type effectiveness has been slightly balanced to slightly power up less useful types. 
    - Dark and Ghost do 1x to Steel
    - Water does 0.5x damage to Ice
    - Ice does 1x to Water
    - Bug does 1x to Ghost and Fairy
    - Steel does 1x to Ice
    - Rock does 0,5x to Rock
    - Rock does 1x to Ground
    - Ground does 1x to Rock
      Choosing the "GenVI+" type chart only adds Steel not resisting Ghost and Dark.
* Nature mints: Adds nature mints to the game, available after the 4th gym, or after becoming champion (if disabled from the start).
* Synchronize: Choose if this ability works like in modern games or like in Gen 3.
* Sturdy: Choose if this ability works like in modern games or like in Gen 3.
* Reusable TMs: Choose between a faithful usage of TMs or a simplistic option that makes TMs infinite. All TMs can be bought in the Battlefrontier Pok√©Mart only if you have Reusable TMs off, and makes Move Tutors one time only just like in the original (Move tutors are infinite if you enable Reusable TMs).
* Sitrus berry: Choose if it works like Gen 3 or like Gen 4+.
* Survive Poison: If enabled, your Pok√©mon will survive poison damage with 1hp when outside of battle.

Features page:
* RTC Type: Choose between using a real clock, or using a fake clock. Fake clock rate is 1h irl, 1 day ingame.
* Shiny Chance: 8192 (Emerald default) - 4096 (Gen VI+) - 2048 - 1024 - 512.
* Item Drops: Items held by wild Pok√©mon, when defeated, will be dropped and obtained by the player. Forget about catching it or using Thief!
* Permanent Fainting: Like a mini-Nuzlocke, without enforcing rules! Your Pok√©mon will stay in the FAINTED status, meaning that you can't use them again. Getting to zero Pok√©mon on the party or PC will make the game Soft-Reset, allowing loading the previous save.
* Uncapped wondertrade: No 3-daily limit.
* Easier Feebas: If enabled, Feebas have a 5% chance to appear around the whole Route 119.
* Frontier bans: Decide if you want legendaries banned or not in Battle Frontier. If enabled, remember that the bans depend on your chosen difficulty!

Randomizer page:
* Includes every option that any randomizer has, and it's completely modular.
  For technical reasons, some special or particular Pok√©mon might not be randomized. 

Nuzlocke page:
* Any option that any Nuzlocker would want to use.

Difficulty page:
* Lock difficulty: locks the current select option that was selected during Birch's Speech and can't be changed in-game. Hard sets "Battle Style" to "Set" always. Beating the game disables the lock.

* Player items: Control whether you can use items in battles, or not.
* Trainer items: Control whether enemy trainers can use items in battles, or not.
* Player IVs: Sets all IVs from wild Pok√©mon to 31 if "No" is chosen. If you choose "No (HP)", it uses between 30 and 31 to allow for different Hidden Powers.
* Trainer IVs: Control whether enemy trainers have 31 IVs in every stat, or if they should have the default IV value set by the game. "Scale" uses gym badges to slowly add IVs. If enabled together with "Player IVs", you'll completely remove IVs from the game (everyone will have 31 IVs)!
* Player EVs: Control whether your Pok√©mon can get EVs, or not. "Off" is Emerald default, "Scale" offers a good challenge, and "Hard" and "Extreme" are what they say they are.
* Trainer EVs: Control whether enemy Pok√©mon can get EVs, or not. Doesn't affect the Battle Frontier, they still have EVs!
* Escape Rope / Dig: Prevent the usage of Escape Rope and prevent using Dig while in dungeons.

**Gameplay related:**
* RNG is fixed and properly works.
* Wonder Trade is available on the basement floor of every Pok√©mon Center, available after the 5th badge (unless you are doing a randomizer, which makes it available from the start, or a challenge, which enables WT after beating the game). The number of Wonder-trades is 3 per day, unless using the "Unlimited Wondertrades" option.
* 3 difficulty modes (EASY, NORMAL and HARD). Selected at the start of the game, can be changed anytime from the options menu (unless using the "Limit difficulty" option).

    EASY mode: Makes the game quite a lot easier by scaling levels down, and obtaining more EXP (+20%).
    - Trainer Pok√©mon and Wild Pok√©mon scale down to 10 levels compared to the original game. More badges, lower levels.
    - There are no restrictions on the Battle Frontier.

    NORMAL mode: Vanilla.
    - No changes, except rematches and small things (also on EASY mode).

    HARD mode: Makes the game a bit more difficult. This mode does not intend to offer a "difficulty" hack-rom, it only tries to be a bit more difficult than vanilla, especially mixed with other options like EV/IV scaling, for example.
    - Experience gain has been lowered by 40% to make up for the level scaling, plus some more. There's an option to remove this slower Exp. gain, although it is not recommended, as it has been hand-crafted and tested.
    - Trainer Pok√©mon and Wild Pok√©mon scale up to 10 levels compared to the original game. More badges, more levels.
    - Certain ace Pok√©mon have had their abilities or items changed to make everything a bit more difficult. This mode does not change anything else in most trainer parties or their strategies.
    - "SET MODE" is automatically selected and can't be disabled if you lock the difficulty.
    - There are more restrictions on the Battle Frontier _(Optional)_.
    - The GEN VI Exp. Share will give less Exp. to the battling Pok√©mon.
    - Legendaries will have higher stats WHILE battling, to make it more challenging, and some will have their catch rate reduced. They are now true Boss Battles! Good luck!

# üîßQUICK FAQ FOR THIS REPO

**I can't compile Modern Emerald!!**
* First thing: When compiling, **you have to use the modern compiler** with the "make modern" command. The old compiler will never work.
* Second thing: The game was compiled using `(devkitARM release 62) 13.2.0`, but it should work up to `release 65`. Higher versions WON'T probably work, for many reasons, as of right now.

**My game crashes on an emulator that's not recent / it's not mGBA or real hardware!**
Decompilation hack-roms may crash or have strange bugs if you are using other emulators other than mGBA or a real GBA. This is not something I can fix, as it relies on the base pokeemerald project adding support or fixes to it.

**Help! PkHex / PKSM / Similar tools or apps can't open the savefile!**
These programs rely on knowing where to find the data on the savefile, and Modern Emerald has modified certain parts of the savedata which makes it incompatible with these apps or tools. Use the debug menu to cheat, as it provides the same options, mostly.
