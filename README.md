# Pokémon Modern Emerald

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald, edited to be "Pokémon Modern Emerald".
You can get more information about Modern Emerald at [Pokecommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=494005)
You can get information on where to find certain Pokémon in my [personal document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QEFJmFhfaZqgxSUnM7MFpufrnrRk_NMzNoNWl2m3y_0/edit#gid=414283818)

# If you want to compile:

Please follow [Pret's guide on how to build the rom](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/INSTALL.md) but using this branch instead of theirs. 
When you compile, use the modern compiler with "make modern". Compiling using the old compiler won't work.

# Features:

**Gamemode**
* Choose between a "Classic" or "Modern" preset, or customize it to your liking.
